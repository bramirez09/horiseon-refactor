# horiseon-refactor

## Description
For the horiseon-refactor project I refactored existing code so semantic html was displayed in a logical order.
I added accessible alt attributes to the images and consolidated and commented on the css sheet. 
All these changes will optimize the site for accessibility from search engines. 

## Visuals
Including mockup
